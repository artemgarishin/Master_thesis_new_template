Intro: 
Code modification, copying or duplication of fragments without any or small modification is general known isuue in code development and support.
According to several studies [roy] there are about 5% to 20% software systems contain a duplicated code, which is generally a result of copy&paste existing fragments of code.

How text to text works:(49)
Prepare first the fragment of code:
1. Comments Removal: Ignores all kinds of comments in the source code depending on the language of interest.
2. Whitespace Removal: Removes tabs, and new line(s) and other blanks spaces.
3. Normalization: Some basic normalization can be applied on the source code (c.f.,Table 3)

First, some detectors are based on lexical analysis. For instance, Baker's Dup [14, 15]
uses a sequence of lines as a representation of source code and detects line-by-line clones.
Therefore, it uses a lexer and a line-based string matching algorithm on the tokens of
the individual lines. Dup removes tabs, whitespace and comments; replaces identi?ers
of functions, variables, and types with a special parameter; concatenates all lines to be
analyzed into a single text line; hashes each line for comparison; and extracts a set of
pairs of longest matches using a sufficx tree algorithm.
